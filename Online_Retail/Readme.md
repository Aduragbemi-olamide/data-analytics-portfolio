# Online Retail Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes online retail transaction data to uncover sales performance patterns, customer purchasing behavior, product demand, and return trends. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of revenue generation, order activity, product performance, and geographic sales distribution to support data-driven retail decision-making.

The analysis focuses on understanding how sales evolve over time, which products and countries drive the most revenue, and where operational inefficiencies such as product returns may be occurring.

## Key Insights
- Sales demonstrate strong seasonality, with significant growth toward the final months of the year and peak performance in Q4.
- A small group of products contributes a disproportionately large share of total revenue, highlighting revenue concentration risk.
- The United Kingdom is the dominant market, generating the majority of global sales compared to other countries.
- Average Order Value (AOV) remains relatively stable despite fluctuations in transaction volume.
- Product returns account for a measurable share of activity, with a small subset of products responsible for most returns.
- Certain return reasons suggest potential issues related to product quality, fulfillment accuracy, or customer expectations.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize inventory planning and marketing efforts around peak sales periods to maximize revenue opportunities.
- Reduce dependency on a narrow set of top-performing products by diversifying product offerings.
- Strengthen quality control and fulfillment checks for products with high return rates.
- Leverage insights from high-performing countries to inform international expansion or targeted marketing strategies.
- Use return rate metrics as an ongoing performance indicator to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
