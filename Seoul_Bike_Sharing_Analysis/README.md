# Seoul Bike Sharing Analysis (2017–2018)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bike rental patterns in Seoul between 2017 and 2018, with a focus on understanding demand trends, seasonal effects, and the impact of weather conditions on bike usage.

The analysis aims to support data-driven decisions for operational planning and urban mobility management.

---

## Objective
- Analyze bike rental trends across time (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Examine seasonal and weather-related impacts on bike demand
- Identify peak usage periods to support operational planning
- Evaluate differences in rentals between holidays and non-holidays

---

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel

---

## Key Insights
- Bike rentals peak during evening hours, with the highest demand occurring around typical commute times.
- Summer and autumn seasons record the highest rental volumes, while winter shows significantly lower demand.
- Higher temperatures are strongly associated with increased bike rentals.
- Bike usage is generally higher on non-holidays compared to holidays.
- Most rental activity occurs on functioning days, which account for over 95% of the dataset.

---

## Recommendations
- Optimize bike availability and redistribution during peak evening hours to meet commuter demand.
- Plan seasonal maintenance and capacity adjustments, particularly increasing supply during summer and autumn.
- Use weather forecasts to anticipate demand fluctuations and improve short-term operational planning.
- Introduce targeted promotions or incentives during low-demand periods, especially in winter.
- Leverage non-holiday usage patterns to improve weekday service efficiency.
