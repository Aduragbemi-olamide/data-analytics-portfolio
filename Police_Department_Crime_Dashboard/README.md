# Police Crime Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes reported crime incidents to identify patterns, trends, and high-risk areas that can support data-driven policing and public safety decisions.

The dashboard was developed using Power BI, with data preparation and cleaning performed in Excel.

---

## Objective
- Analyze crime trends across time, location, and demographics
- Identify peak crime periods and high-incidence zones
- Support proactive and evidence-based policing strategies

---

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel

---

## Key Insights
- Crime incidents are more frequent during weekday evening hours
- A small number of crime types account for a large share of reported incidents
- Residential areas experience higher crime frequency than other zones
- Certain age groups are disproportionately affected
