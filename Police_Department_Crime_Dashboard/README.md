# Police Crime Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes reported crime incidents to identify patterns, trends, and high-risk areas that can support data-driven policing and public safety decisions.

The dashboard was developed using Microsoft Excel, with data preparation and cleaning also performed in Excel.

---

## Objective
- Analyze crime trends across time, location, and demographics
- Identify peak crime periods and high-incidence zones
- Support proactive and evidence-based policing strategies

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

---

## Key Insights
- Crime incidents are heavily concentrated during weekday evening hours, particularly between late afternoon and night-time periods.
- A small subset of crime categories accounts for a disproportionately large share of total reported incidents.
- Residential neighborhoods experience higher crime frequency compared to commercial or industrial areas.
- Certain demographic groups, particularly older and vulnerable populations, are more frequently affected by reported crimes.


---

## Recommendations
- Implement time-targeted policing strategies by aligning patrol deployment with identified peak crime hours rather than uniform coverage.
- Develop seasonal and periodic crime-prevention plans to proactively address anticipated spikes instead of reacting after incidents occur.
- Increase protection and outreach initiatives for vulnerable demographic groups to reduce exposure and improve public safety outcomes.
- Allocate law enforcement resources more efficiently by prioritizing high-frequency crime zones and residential hotspots.
- Strengthen monitoring and enforcement efforts for high-impact crime categories that contribute most significantly to overall crime levels.
